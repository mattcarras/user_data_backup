# user_data_backup
Executable scripts for logging, backing up, and restoring user data. Intended for IT shops. WinPE compatible.

These are currently a collection of AutoIT scripts to log and transfer the commonly backed-up and restored user data--the non-hidden, non-system folders under "Users" on Windows Vista and up. For a computer repair shop data backup is a common task that may be performed by a number of different tools and sometimes extensive logging is not one of the features of an otherwise decent toolset. These scripts provide easy logging to either the current Desktop folder or a network share using built-in Windows tools that should be available even in any WinPE environment, intended to be kept in the store's records even after the user's data has been restored.
